Changelog
=========

1.7 - unreleased
----------------

- Import aq_acquire instead of trying to acquire it from the full feed
  view, since self.aq_acquire is not available in some cases.
  [jcerjak]

- Use strings instead of integers as CacheTimeoutVocabulary values and cast
  them into integers where needed, so that Generic Setup can import feedmixer
  portlet.xml configurations, where properties are always handled as strings.
  [thet]

- remove deprecation warning on plone4.1

1.6 - 2011-09-13
----------------

* Make it plone 4 compatible, thanks to Rafahela Garcia Bazzanella for fix [martior]

* Added Portuguese Brazilian transaltions from Rafahela Garcia Bazzanella [martior]

* Direct import of  IVocabularyFactory for Plone 4.1 compatibility. [lewy]

* Fix bad cache key on entries(). Previously, the repr of a generator object
  was used. This meant effectively no request caching. Worse, it caused intermittent
  cache-key overlap with more than one portlet rendered in the same request.
  [tmog]

1.5 - 2011-03-02
----------------

* Wrap the full feed's entries in a div so we can visually separate them.
  [jbaldivieso]

* Fix the full feed's lookup of the feed entries so that the caching decorator
  can acquire the request from the view as it expects.
  [davisagli]

* Explicitly include plone.app.portlets' ZCML to ensure the plone.portlet
  directive works in all cases.
  [hannosch]

* Added Spanish translation
  [macagua]

1.4 - 2009-11-06
----------------

* Removed edit permission as this prevents feedmixer portlet being added to a
  user's dashboard.
  [matth]

1.3 - 2009-04-03
----------------

* Fix the full_feed view to have fallback when getting description from an feed
  item as it is not a required field in the rss2 standard.
  [martior]

1.2 - 2008-07-10
----------------

* Fix the "More ..." link of the portlet. We have to store the path to the
  context of the portlet assignment, because plone[.app].portlets doesn't
  expose it. This workaround was taken from ely.portlets.image.
  This will only work for newly created feedmixer portlets, existing ones
  will still create wrong urls in subfolders.
  [fschulze]

* Added french translation and made some i18n fixes.
  [glenfant]

1.1 - 2007-11-28
----------------

* Correct caching of mixed feed entries: caching per instance instead of
  per request meant we would never update our feed as long as the ZODB
  did not expire the assignment. Instead to cache per request and using the
  list of feed_urls of the assignment.
  [wichert]

* Fix typo in the portletBottomLeft CSS class name.
  [daftdog]

1.0 - 2007-11-05
----------------

* Initial release.
